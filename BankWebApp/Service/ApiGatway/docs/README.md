## 1. Introduction

### API Gateway Overview

The **API Gateway** is the single-entry point for all client requests in a microservices architecture. It is responsible for request routing, authentication, authorization, and more.

#### Key Features in Local Setup

- **Routing**: Forwards requests to local microservices based on predefined paths (e.g., `/auth/**`, `/notification/**`, `/download/**`).
- **Centralized Access Point**: Clients can interact with multiple backend services via a single host and port.
- **Local Debugging**: Facilitates end-to-end testing and logging for efficient debugging.

### 3.1.1 Security Config

The `SecurityConfig` class secures the API Gateway using **Spring WebFlux Security** and **OAuth2 JWT** authentication.

#### Responsibilities:

- **Token-based Authentication**: Validates incoming JWT tokens from Keycloak using a custom `KeycloakRoleConverter`.
- **Public Route Configuration**: Allows public access to specific endpoints like authentication and health checks.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
  - `ROLE_service`: For service-level operations (e.g., balance retrieval).
  - `ROLE_employee`: For employee-level access (e.g., freezing accounts).
  - `ROLE_admin`: For admin features (e.g., adding branches).
- **CSRF Disabled**: As it's stateless and RESTful, CSRF protection is turned off.

### 3.1.2 Keycloak Role Converter

The `KeycloakRoleConverter` maps Keycloak roles from a JWT token into Spring Security roles.

#### Key Actions:

- Extracts roles from the `realm_access.roles` claim in the JWT.
- Converts roles into the format `ROLE_<role>` (e.g., `admin` â†’ `ROLE_admin`).

#### Example:

**JWT Claim**:
```json
"realm_access": {
  "roles": ["admin", "employee"]
}
